Their goal in the colonies of America was referred to mixed responsibilities.	0.7811225094690964	1.1821	-2.0032	3.1853	Score: -2. The translation misrenders “මිශ්‍ර වගාවන්” (mixed farming/crops) as “mixed responsibilities,” uses the awkward passive “was referred to” instead of a phrase like “was directed toward” or “aimed at,” and thus entirely distorts the original idea of agricultural intent in the American colonies, making it essentially incomprehensible.

The translation mangles key phrases, rendering “आफु स्वतन्त्र भएपछि” as “itself became independent” instead of “was unbanned,” omits Mandela’s leadership context, turns “चुनावमा भाग लिन पाएपछि” (“after being allowed to contest elections”) into “received election to the leadership of the assembly,” invents “assembly,” and thus distorts the original meaning beyond simple errors.

The translation completely misrenders the meaning: “एकलाख भन्दा माथी जनसङ्ख्या रहेको छ” (there are more than 100,000 people) is turned into a meaningless comparison (“belongs to mahendranagar rather than aelakh”), misreading “एकलाख” as “aelakh” and substituting “majority” and “belongs” in place of “population size,” thus failing to convey the original fact."

The translation commits a critical mistranslation by rendering amistițiul (“the armistice”) as “the notification,” which completely alters the meaning of the sentence; aside from this semantic disaster, other elements (e.g., “same railway wagon”) are passable but the core information is lost, making the translation essentially incomprehensible in context.
